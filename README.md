# ðŸŽ¨ GEN_Project_For_Retail_Store: Talk to a Database  

**GEN_Project_For_Retail_Store** is an *end-to-end LLM project* that allows users to **interact with a MySQL database using natural language**. The system converts user questions into **SQL queries**, executes them on the database, and returns **accurate answers**.  

This project simulates a **T-shirt retail store** where inventory, sales, and discounts are tracked in MySQL. A store manager can ask questions like:  

- *How many white Adidas T-shirts are left in stock?*  
- *How much sales revenue will be generated if all extra-small T-shirts are sold today?*  

The system intelligently **generates SQL queries** and executes them automatically.
